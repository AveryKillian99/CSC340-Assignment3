            The Computer Shack is a small business operated both locally and online with the 
            one goal of satisfying all your tech based desires. Have you ever tried to contact a company for a product or service?
            Have you sat through being transferred from one department to the next spending large amounts of time on hold?
            Personally I hate it when that happens to me so I vowed to ensure my business would never be like that. 
            While smaller than most name-brand operations I take that small town business feel and apply it to your experience guaranteeing you the luxury of knowing 
            who is working on your request at all times. I accept personal meetings, phone calls, video calls, and emails to best connect
            with you and build a professional relationship with all my customers. You will never be placed on hold or wonder who exactly is handling your project here
            so contact me today!

                Services <br>
                Here at The Computer Shack we specialize in computer related tasks. <br>
                That does not mean however, that we will not accept other tech related requests. <br>
                If you have a non computer tech Problem then feel free to ask me about it <br>
                and if I do not know how to handle it myself I can guarantee that I know someone who does.

            <h4>
                Prices <br>
                The main services offered here involve computer repairs, computer upgrades, and new computer builds.
                This applies to desktops and laptop however prices vary based upon time costs and hardware. <br>
                For computer builds I will do my best to find the cheapest components that you request or that fit your 
                specifcations to keep costs low, and the cost of parts will then be added to your total. In addition to 
                this there will be an added $150 for the build of single motherboard machines and $300 for multi motherboard
                server builds. <br>
                For computer upgrades The cost is the cost of the upgrade along with $50 per components ie: new motherboard $50, new gpu $50 etc <br>
                Lastly repair jobs are more tricky and require time spent analyzing the problem before a decision can be made. 
                So I will inspect the hardware free of charge, tell you the recommended repairs it needs and then offer my price to do so. I am 
                open to negotiation and if my prices are too steep then there will be no hard feelings if you go somewhere else. <br>
                Any other tech related jobs can be discussed and if I have the ability to provide what you need then prices can be determined and haggled.
