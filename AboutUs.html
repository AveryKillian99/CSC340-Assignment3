        <h2>
            About me
        </h2>
        <p>
            I am a small business owner with the goal of turning my passion for computers and electronics
            into a career. With that in mind I can always promise to provide the best services for you because
            this is more than just a job for me, its my passion. Every single computer that passes through my shop
            will always be worked on with pride because there is nothing I enjoy more than to work on computers. 

        </p>

        <h2>
            Qualifications
        </h2>
        <p>
            I have built experience in this field by working on and building computer for myself and others over the 
            past several years now. In addition to that I am also currently enrolled at UNCG for a Computer Science major.
            So not only am I experienced with the physical components of a computer, I am also learning the software components 
            as well. This gives me a reliable blend of experience and knowledge to tackle all trials and hardships with computers.
        </p>
